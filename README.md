# ContractComparisonSQL
Old university project that improves on ContractComparison. This website has a much simpler layout style, however is much more scalable with the addition of a MySQL Database for contract entries, as opposed to static XML/XSLT pages as seen in the original [ContractComparison](https://github.com/AlexBailey/ContractComparison).

Uses HTML, PHP, MySQL.
